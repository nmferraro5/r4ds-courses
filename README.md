### Overview
This course will make you an expert at data I/O, transformation, programming, and visualization in R. 
We will use a consistent set of packages for these tasks called the `tidyverse`.

This is not a traditional programming or computer science course. 
It is meant to be an *applied* tour of how to actually use R for your data science needs. 
We also will not cover statistical analysis of data in this course, but the curriculum is a useful prerequisite for subsequent courses on statistics or machine learning.

This course is not graded, nor are there any assignments or homework. The lectures are just to get you started- they will be frequently interrupted by active learning exercises that you will be asked to complete in pairs or small groups. That's where the real learning will happen!

### Prerequisites
No prior experience with R is expected. Those with experience using R will still likely find much of value in this course since it covers a more modern style of R programming that has only recently gained traction.

You will need to install R (and RStudio) to follow along with the material, or have access to a machine that has that software installed.
[Follow this link](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and click on the appropriate options for your operating system to install R, 
then do the same to [install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

### Learning Goals
By the end of the course, you will be able to:

* comfortably use R through the Rstudio interface
* read and write tabular data between R and flat files
* subset, transform, summarize, join, and plot data
* write reusable and readable programs
* seek out, learn, and integrate new packages into your analyses

### Textbook
We will be using parts of the fantastic book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (R4DS) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) and Garrett Grolemund (O'Reilly Media, 2017); it is online and also available in hardcopy.

### Slides
Slides can be found [here](https://github.com/alejandroschuler/r4ds-courses/tree/advance-2020/lectures). Download the `.html` files for the "finished" product or the `.Rpres` files to see how the sausage is made.

# Motivation

### Why R?
What does `R` have going for it? 
Dr. Wickham puts it well in the introduction to his other book, [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html):

* It’s free, open source, and available on every major platform. As a result, if you do your analysis in R, anyone can easily replicate it.
* A massive set of packages for statistical modelling, machine learning, visualisation, and importing and manipulating data. Whatever model or graphic you’re trying to do, chances are that someone has already tried to do it. At a minimum, you can learn from their efforts.
* Cutting edge tools. Researchers in statistics and machine learning will often publish an R package to accompany their articles. This means immediate access to the very latest statistical techniques and implementations.
* Deep-seated language support for data analysis. This includes features likes missing values, data frames, and subsetting.
* A fantastic community. It is easy to get help from experts on the R-help mailing list, stackoverflow, or subject-specific mailing lists like R-SIG-mixed-models or ggplot2. You can also connect with other R learners via twitter, linkedin, and through many local user groups.
* Powerful tools for communicating your results. R packages make it easy to produce html or pdf reports, or create interactive websites.
* A strong foundation in functional programming. The ideas of functional programming are well suited to solving many of the challenges of data analysis. R provides a powerful and flexible toolkit which allows you to write concise yet descriptive code.
* An IDE tailored to the needs of interactive data analysis and statistical programming.
* Powerful metaprogramming facilities. R is not just a programming language, it is also an environment for interactive data analysis. Its metaprogramming capabilities allow you to write magically succinct and concise functions and provide an excellent environment for designing domain-specific languages.
* Designed to connect to high-performance programming languages like C, Fortran, and C++.

[Coming from SAS or excel, R can seem daunting](http://r4stats.com/articles/why-r-is-hard-to-learn/). 
That's a perfectly normal feeling! 
R is a fully-fledged programming language that can handle a lot more than data analysis, 
so it is naturally a little more complicated. I promise you that it is worth the effort.

If you already have some experience programming, R may seem quirky and inefficient to you.
That's also a normal feeling! 
You can find many hilarious takes on R's idiosyncrasies and problems scattered around the internet.
Some of my favorites are:
- [The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf): a detailed guide to the base language, written partially in the style of *Dante's Inferno*.
- [aRrgh: a newcomer's (angry) guide to R](http://arrgh.tim-smith.us/): an experienced software engineer rants about R's quirks
- [Rbitrary standards](https://ironholds.org/projects/rbitrary/): a little about the history of R's strangest features
- [Evaluating the design of the R language](https://haben-michael.github.io/stats195/Morendat%20et%20al.%20--%20Evaluating%20the%20design%20of%20the%20R%20language.pdf): academic computer scientists dissect R in this peer-reviewed paper. Highly technical.

Although some of the odd design choices are precisely what enable its most powerful features, 
[there are certainly improvements that could be made](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Performance.html#language-performance).

### Why tidyverse?
The tidyverse solves both of these problems: 
it makes R [accessible to data analysts](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) 
and cleaner for experienced programmers. 
It provides a consistent and principled framework for R programming that is easier to learn
and produces code that is easier to maintain than base R.

Of course, the tidyverse and adjacent packages are not always the right tool for the job. 
Other useful packages and frameworks include:
- `data.table`: fast data manipulation and rolling joins
- `zoo`: functions for time-series data
- `Rcpp`: helpers to write efficient C++ code that can be called by R

Furthermore, if you are writing your own package for the public, you may want to use base R as much as possible to reduce its dependency on other code.

All in all, though, the tidyverse provides by far the best unified interface to data anlysis in R.
It should be your go-to toolbox, even if there are tools you have that don't fit in it.
